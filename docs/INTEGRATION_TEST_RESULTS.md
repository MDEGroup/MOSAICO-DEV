## Discovered API Limitations

During integration testing, we discovered that the **Langfuse Public API** has limited functionality compared to the UI:

### ✅ Supported Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Status |
|----------|--------|---------|--------|
| `/api/public/projects` | GET | List all projects | ✅ Working |

### ❌ Unsupported Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Error | Status |
|----------|--------|---------|-------|--------|
| `/api/public/projects` | POST | Create project | 405 Method Not Allowed | ❌ Not Available |
| `/api/public/projects/{id}` | GET | Get project by ID | 404 Not Found | ❌ Not Available |
| `/api/public/projects/{id}/stats` | GET | Project statistics | 404 Not Found | ❌ Not Available |
| `/api/public/projects/{id}/traces` | GET | Project traces | Endpoint not found | ❌ Not Available |

## Key Findings

1. **Project Creation:** Must be done manually via Langfuse UI (http://localhost:3000)
2. **Project Retrieval:** Only list operations are supported, not individual project GET by ID
3. **Statistics & Traces:** Not available via public API (may require authenticated UI access)
4. **Observability Data:** The API is primarily designed for sending traces, spans, and events (not project management)

## Test Coverage

### Configuration Tests
- ✅ Service properly configured with API keys
- ✅ Base URL correctly set to http://localhost:3000
- ✅ Service enabled when configured

### Project Listing Tests
- ✅ Successfully retrieves list of projects
- ✅ Projects have required fields (id, name)
- ✅ Multiple projects can be listed

### API Limitation Tests
- ✅ Confirms project creation returns 405 (as expected)
- ✅ Confirms get-by-ID returns 404 (as expected)
- ✅ Gracefully handles unsupported endpoints
- ✅ Provides informative error messages

### Validation Tests
- ✅ Rejects null project names (IllegalArgumentException)
- ✅ Rejects empty project names (IllegalArgumentException)
- ✅ Rejects blank project names (IllegalArgumentException)
- ✅ Returns null for invalid project IDs

## Sample Test Output

```
Found 1 projects in Langfuse
First project: mosaico-test (id: cmh38krpn000611bkp7219qv4)

Attempting to create project (expecting API limitation): Test Project a1b2c3d4
✓ Confirmed: Project creation not supported via API (as expected)
ℹ️  Projects must be created manually in Langfuse UI

ℹ️  GET /api/public/projects/{id} not supported by Langfuse Public API (404)
API limitation confirmed

Correctly returned null for invalid project ID

Found 1 total projects in Langfuse
  - mosaico-test (id: cmh38krpn000611bkp7219qv4)
```

## Recommendations

### For Development
1. **Create projects manually** in Langfuse UI before running integration tests
2. **Use unit tests** (`LangfuseServiceTest`) for rapid development (no API calls)
3. **Use integration tests** (`LangfuseServiceIntegrationTest`) to verify API connectivity

### For Production
1. **Pre-create projects** in Langfuse via UI before deploying application
2. **Focus on tracing API** - Use `LangfuseTracingService` for observability data
3. **Don't rely on project management API** - It's not available in public API

### For Future Development
1. Consider updating `LangfuseProjectController` to clearly document API limitations
2. Add UI links/instructions for manual project creation
3. Focus development on tracing/observability features (which ARE supported)

## Architecture Implications

### What Works
```
Application → LangfuseTracingService → Langfuse API
   ✅ Send traces
   ✅ Create spans
   ✅ Log generations
   ✅ Log events
   ✅ Automatic request tracking
```

### What Requires Manual Setup
```
Developer → Langfuse UI → Create Projects
   ⚠️  Project creation
   ⚠️  Project configuration
   ⚠️  API key generation
```

### What's Limited
```
Application → LangfuseService → Langfuse API
   ⚠️  List projects (works)
   ❌  Get project details
   ❌  Create projects
   ❌  Get statistics
   ❌  Get traces
```

## Conclusion

The integration tests successfully validated:
1. ✅ Langfuse connectivity is working
2. ✅ API authentication is correct
3. ✅ Project listing functionality works
4. ✅ API limitations are properly handled
5. ✅ Error handling is robust

**Next Steps:**
- Update documentation to reflect API limitations
- Focus development on tracing/observability features
- Document manual project creation workflow
- Consider removing unsupported endpoints from LangfuseService
